    <h2>Projectile Motion</h2>
	<p>
		Projectile is defined as, any body thrown with some initial velocity, which is then allowed to move under the action of gravity alone, without being propelled by any engine or fuel. The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory. A projectile moves at a constant speed in the horizontal direction while experiencing a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 downwards in the vertical direction. To be consistent, we define the up or upwards direction to be the positive direction. Therefore the acceleration of gravity is, -9.8 m/s2.
	</p>
	<h3>Horizontal motion of projectile</h3>
	<p>
		The speed in the horizontal direction is 'vx' and this speed doesn't change. The equation which predicts the position at any time in the horizontal direction is simply,
	</p>

	<h3>Vertical motion of projectile</h3>
	<p>
		Because gravity has a downward pull, the vertical velocity changes constantly. The equation that predicts the vertical velocity at any time 'vy' is
	</p>
	<img src="https://vlab.amrita.edu/fckeditor/editor/plugins/fckeditor_wiris/integration/showimage.php?formula=f95ec12762786ff5fa2010b60ca87eff.png">
	<p>The 'Voy' is simply the original velocity in the vertical or y-direction. </p>
	<p>
		To calculate the position in the y-direction, the full distance formula must be used. 'Yo', represents the original position in the y-direction.
	</p>

	<p>
		Acceleration for projectiles near the Earth's surface is -9.8 m/s2. We don't re-write the equation with a negative sign.  Rather, we use the negative acceleration value when solving problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a projectile is launched horizontally  a ball rolls off a table, a car runs off the edge of a cliff, etc.  Here the original y-velocity is zero. For example, if the projectile drops 10 meters, you can set the Yo = 0 and Yf = -10 m. Or, you can set Yo = 10 m and Yf = 0. Either works out the same.
	</p>
	<h3>Velocity</h3>
	<p>To determine the total velocity of a projectile, we combine the horizontal velocity
('vx') and the vertical velocity ('vy') using the Pythagorean Theorem,
	</p>

	<h3>At maximum height</h3>
	<p>
		At the top of its path, the projectile no longer is going up and hasn't started down, yet. Its vertical velocity is zero ( vy = 0 ). The only velocity it has is just its horizontal velocity, vx. Remember, the horizontal speed stays constant throughout the projectile path.

A common misconception occurs at the top of a projectile's arc. When asked what the acceleration of the projectile is at this point, many people answer "zero". If it were zero, the projectile would simply keep going in a straight line. However, gravity is still acting, pulling it down, and accelerating it towards the earth. Thus the acceleration at the top is still -9.8 m/s2, just as it's been all along.
	</p>
	<h3>Range of projectile motion</h3>
	<p>
		For a projectile that is launched at an angle and returns to the same height, we can determine the range or distance it goes horizontally using a fairly simple equation. However, we will focus on the results of studying that equation rather than solving it here.

 

    When the projectile is launched at a steep angle, it spends more time in the air than it does when launched at a shallow angle.
    When the projectile is launched at a shallow angle, it goes faster in the horizontal direction than if it is launched at a steep angle.

 

The ideal combination of time in the air and horizontal speed occurs at 45o. Thus the maximum range or distance occurs when the projectile is launched at this angle. This applies to long jumpers and soccer balls that are two good examples. However, if the projectile starts at a point higher than where it lands, the ideal distance doesn't occur at a 45o angle. Ask your instructor for an explanation. If you calculate the range for a projectile launched at 30o, you will find it's the same as a projectile launched at 60o. The same goes for 40o and 50o. The graph of range vs angle is symmetrical around the 45o maximum.

The equations used to find out various parameters are shown below;

  <h2>Coefficient of Restitution</h2>

  <p>
    If v be the vertically upward velocity with which the sphere rebounds to a height H, then v=√2gH.Since both u & v are perpendicular to the horizontal plane, the collision is direct.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here the relative velocity of approach between the sphere & the plane =u−0 & the relative velocity of seperation =v−0. If e be the coefficient of restitution between the material of the sphere & the plane, then by definition 
    e=v*u  and so we find:
  </p>
  <p>
    e=√2gH/√2gh
    <br>
    H=(e^2).h
    which is the result you were looking for.

<p>There are basically four factors that govern swing of
  the cricket ball:</p>

<ul>*Seam</ul>
<ul>*Asymmetry in ball due to uneven tear</ul>
<ul>*Speed</ul>
<ul>*Bowling Action</ul>

<h2>THE BOUNDARY LAYER</h2>

<p>• When a sphere travels through air, the air will be forced to negotiate a path
  around the ball</p>

<p>
  • The Boundary Layer is defined as the small layer of air that is in contact
  with the surface of a projectile as it moves through the air
</p>

<p>• Initially the air that hits the front of the ball will stick to the ball and
  accelerate in order to obtain the balls velocity.</p>

<p>• In doing so it applies pressure (Force) in the opposite direction to the balls
  velocity by NIII Law, this is known as a Drag Force.</p>

<p>• As this boundary layer moves around the sphere, it loses velocity as it is
  essentially ‘slipping off’ of the sphere and the sphere can no longer apply a
  force on the boundary layer to keep it at the spheres velocity</p>

  <p>• As the boundary layer ‘slips’ off of the sphere, it approaches zero velocity in
    which the boundary layer no longer has any effect on the ball.</p>

<p>• At this point the air will separate from the ball, This is known as the
  boundary separation point </p>


<h2>BOUNDARY LAYER SEPARATION</h2>


<p>• As the boundary layer separates from a sphere, it forms a wake.</p>
<p>• A wake is an area of low pressure that appears directly after the separation point of the
  boundary layer</p>
  <p>• This wake is created by the separating boundary layer as it is accelerated off the surface of the
    sphere. By Newton's Third Law, the wake will then cause an equal and opposite force on the
    sphere.</p>
